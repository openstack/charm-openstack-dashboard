      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.

      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.

    description: |
      If True, imposes source IP based rate limits on accessing the dashboard.
      The actual limits are controlled through the configuration options:
      haproxy-limit-period and haproxy-max-bytes-in-rate.
  haproxy-max-bytes-in-rate:
    type: int
    default: 500000

    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      "max-age" parameter for HSTS(HTTP Strict Transport Security)
      header. Use with caution since once you set this option, browsers
      will remember it so they can only use HTTPS (HTTP connection won't
      be allowed) until max-age expires.
      .
      An example value is one year (31536000). However, a shorter
      max-age such as 24 hours (86400) is recommended during initial
      rollout in case of any mistakes. For more details on HSTS, refer to:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security
      .
      For this option to have an effect, SSL must be configured and
      enforce-ssl option must be true.

      instance. This option has an effect only to Ocata or newer
      releases.
  hide-create-volume:
    type: boolean
    default: False

      Hide the "Create New Volume" option and rely on the
      default-create-volume value during instance creation.
  image-formats:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The image-formats setting can be used to alter the default list of
      advertised image formats.  Many installations cannot use all the formats
      that Glance recognizes, restricting the list here prevents unwanted
      formats from being listed in Horizon which can lead to confusion.
      .
      This setting takes a space separated list, for example: iso qcow2 raw
      .
      Supported formats are: aki, ami, ari, docker, iso, ova, qcow2, raw, vdi,
      vhd, vmdk.
      .
      If not provided, leave the option unconfigured which enables all of the

      this service. By default, the number of workers for each daemon is
      set to twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has. This default
      value will be capped to 4 workers unless this configuration option
      is set.
  api-result-limit:

    default:
    description: |
      The maximum number of objects (e.g. Swift objects or Glance images) to
      display on a single page before providing a paging element (a "more" link)
      to paginate results.
  enable-fip-topology-check:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description:
      By default Horizon checks that a project has a router attached to an
      external network before allowing FIPs to be attached to a VM. Some use
      cases will not meet this constraint, e.g. if the router is owned by a
      different project. Setting this to False removes this check from Horizon.
  enable-consistency-groups:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default Cinder does not enable the Consistency Groups feature. To
      avoid having the Consistency Groups tabs on Horizon without the feature
      enabled on Cinder, this also defaults to False. Setting this to True
      will make the Consistency Groups tabs appear on the dashboard.
      .
      This option is supported for releases up to OpenStack Stein only. As of
      OpenStack Train, consistency groups have been dropped and replaced by
      the generic group feature. Setting this option for OpenStack Train or
      above will not do anything.
  use-policyd-override:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True then use the resource named 'policyd-override' to install
      override YAML files in the horizon's policy directories.  The resource
      file should be a ZIP file containing YAML policy files.  These are to be
      placed into directories that indicate the service that the policy file
      belongs to.  Please see the README of the charm for further details.
      .
      If False then remove/disable any overrides in force.
  disable-password-reveal:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      If enabled, the reveal button for passwords is removed.
  enforce-password-check:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      If True, displays an â€˜Admin Passwordâ€™ field on the Change Password form
      to verify that it is indeed the admin logged-in who wants to change the password.
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for internal
      communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
